# AI-Engineer-Roadmap-for-Beginners

### AI Engineer Roadmap for Beginners

Following is the roadmap to learning **AI Engineer** (also known as **ML Engineer** ) skills for a total
beginner. It includes FREE learning resources for technical skills (or tool skills) and soft (or core) skills

Prerequisites: You must have skills or interests to build skills in Coding and Math. Without these two
you cannot become an AI engineer.

Total Duration: **8 Months** ( **4 hours** of study Every Day)

Also, **AI Engineer = Data Scientist + Software Engineer**

#### Week 0: Do Proper Research and protect yourself from SCAMS.

#### Unfortunately, a lot of systematic scams are happening in ed tech, especially in the

data field where aspirants are provided with false promises like a 100% job guarantee or
trapped into “Masterclasses” which are nothing but sales pitches to upsell their low-grade
courses at exorbitant prices. You need to do complete research about the market and
mentors before starting your journey. Providing you the links to a few posts that we have
made in this regard which will support your research.

Even though these posts are **NOT** sufficient, do your additional research.
