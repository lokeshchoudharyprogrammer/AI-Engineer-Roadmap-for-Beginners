Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation with code examples in Python for each day of the weekly plan:

### Week 1: Computer Science Fundamentals ğŸ’»

#### Day 1:
- **Topic: Introduction to Bits and Bytes**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Bits are the smallest unit of data in computing, representing a binary digit (0 or 1). A byte consists of 8 bits.
    - Text and numbers are stored in computers using binary code, where characters and digits are represented by specific patterns of bits.
    - The binary number system uses base-2, with each digit representing a power of 2.

  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Converting decimal number 25 to binary
    decimal_number = 25
    binary_number = bin(decimal_number)
    print("Binary representation of 25:", binary_number)
    # Output: Binary representation of 25: 0b11001
    ```

#### Day 2:
- **Topic: Basics of Computer Networks**
  - **Explanation:**
    - An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It's used for communication and routing of data.
    - Internet routing protocols help routers determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination.
    - IP addresses are different from MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, which are unique identifiers assigned to network interfaces.

  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Example IP address
    ip_address = "192.168.1.1"
    print("IP Address:", ip_address)

    # Example of a routing protocol
    routing_protocol = "BGP"  # Border Gateway Protocol
    print("Routing Protocol:", routing_protocol)
    ```

#### Day 3:
- **Topic: Understanding Protocols**
  - **Explanation:**
    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that provides faster data transfer but with no guarantee of delivery.
    - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered data delivery.
    - HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring web pages and resources on the World Wide Web.

  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Using the requests library for an HTTP GET request
    import requests

    response = requests.get('http://www.example.com')
    print("HTTP Status Code:", response.status_code)
    print("Response Content:", response.text)
    ```

#### Day 4:
- **Topic: Programming Basics - Variables and Control Structures**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Variables in Python are containers for storing data values. They can hold different types of data such as integers, floats, strings, etc.
    - If statements are used for conditional execution of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
    - Loops, like `for` and `while`, allow for repeated execution of code.

  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Variables and if condition
    temperature = 30
    if temperature > 25:
        print("It's hot outside!")
    else:
        print("It's not too hot.")

    # Loop example - printing numbers from 1 to 10
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)
    ```

#### Day 5:
- **Topic: More on Programming - Strings and Functions**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Strings in Python are sequences of characters. They can be manipulated using various methods like `split()`, `join()`, `replace()`, etc.
    - Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the `def` keyword.

  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # String manipulation
    str1 = "Hello"
    str2 = "World"
    greeting = str1 + ", " + str2 + "!"
    print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, World!

    # Function to reverse a string
    def reverse_string(s):
        return s[::-1]

    reversed_str = reverse_string("Hello")
    print(reversed_str)  # Output: olleH
    ```

#### Day 6:
- **Topic: Algorithm Basics**
  - **Explanation:**
    - An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.
    - Brute force algorithms try every possible solution to find the correct one.
    - Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices with the hope of finding a global optimum.

  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Bubble Sort algorithm
    def bubble_sort(arr):
        n = len(arr)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(0, n-i-1):
                if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                    arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
        return arr

    numbers = [5, 3, 8, 2, 1, 4]
    sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)
    print("Sorted Numbers:", sorted_numbers)  # Output: Sorted Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]

    # Recursive Fibonacci sequence
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        else:
            return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

    for i in range(10):
        print(fibonacci(i))
    ```

#### Day 7:
- **Topic: Review and Practice**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Review all topics covered during the week.
    - Practice coding problems related to variables, strings, if conditions, loops, and algorithms.

  - **Assignment:**
    - Solve coding problems related to variables, strings, if conditions, loops, and algorithms.
    - Review your code from earlier in the week and refactor/improve it.

### Week 2: Computer Science Fundamentals ğŸ’»

#### Day 1:
- **Topic: Data Structures - Arrays and Lists**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Arrays and lists are collections of elements in Python.
    - Arrays are a part of the core Python language, while lists are more flexible and can hold elements of different types.

  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Arrays in Python
    import array as arr
    my_array = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    print("Array:", my_array)

    # Lists in Python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    print("List:", my_list)
    ```

#### Day 2:
- **Topic: More on Data Structures - Stacks and Queues**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Stacks and queues are data structures that follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) and First In First Out (FIFO) principles, respectively.
    - They can be implemented using lists in Python.

  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Stack implementation using a list
    stack = []
    stack.append(1)
    stack.append(2)
    stack.append(3)
    print("Stack:", stack)
    # Pop from stack
    popped_item = stack.pop()
    print


Certainly! Continuing from where we left off:

### Week 2: Computer Science Fundamentals ğŸ’»

#### Day 2 (Continued):
- **Topic: More on Data Structures - Stacks and Queues**
  - **Code Example (Continued):**
    ```python
    # Stack implementation using a list
    stack = []
    stack.append(1)
    stack.append(2)
    stack.append(3)
    print("Stack:", stack)
    # Pop from stack
    popped_item = stack.pop()
    print("Popped Item from Stack:", popped_item)
    print("Updated Stack:", stack)

    # Queue implementation using a list
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque()
    queue.append(1)
    queue.append(2)
    queue.append(3)
    print("Queue:", queue)
    # Dequeue from queue
    dequeued_item = queue.popleft()
    print("Dequeued Item from Queue:", dequeued_item)
    print("Updated Queue:", queue)
    ```

#### Day 3:
- **Topic: Recursion**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
    - It involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems until they become simple enough to solve directly.
    
  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Recursive function to calculate factorial
    def factorial(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n - 1)

    print("Factorial of 5:", factorial(5))

    # Recursive function for Fibonacci series
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return n
        else:
            return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

    for i in range(10):
        print(fibonacci(i))
    ```

#### Day 4:
- **Topic: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
  - **Explanation:**
    - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods.
    - Classes are blueprints for creating objects, defining their properties (attributes), and behaviors (methods).
    - Key concepts include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
    
  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Example of a simple class in Python
    class Person:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age

        def greet(self):
            return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."

    # Creating an instance of the Person class
    person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
    print(person1.greet())

    # Inheritance example
    class Student(Person):
        def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
            super().__init__(name, age)
            self.student_id = student_id

        def study(self, subject):
            return f"{self.name} is studying {subject}."

    student1 = Student("Bob", 25, "12345")
    print(student1.greet())
    print(student1.study("Mathematics"))
    ```

#### Day 5:
- **Topic: More on OOP - Abstraction and Interfaces**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
    - Interfaces define a contract for classes to follow. They specify what methods a class should implement without providing the implementation.
    
  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Example of abstraction
    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    class Shape(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def area(self):
            pass

        @abstractmethod
        def perimeter(self):
            pass

    class Circle(Shape):
        def __init__(self, radius):
            self.radius = radius

        def area(self):
            return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

        def perimeter(self):
            return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius

    circle = Circle(5)
    print("Area of Circle:", circle.area())
    print("Perimeter of Circle:", circle.perimeter())
    ```

#### Day 6:
- **Topic: Design Patterns**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design.
    - They provide a template for solving certain issues and promote best practices in coding.
    
  - **Code Example:**
    ```python
    # Singleton Design Pattern
    class Singleton:
        _instance = None

        def __new__(cls):
            if cls._instance is None:
                cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
            return cls._instance

    obj1 = Singleton()
    obj2 = Singleton()
    print(obj1 == obj2)  # Output: True (Both refer to the same instance)
    ```

#### Day 7:
- **Topic: Review and Practice**
  - **Explanation:**
    - Review all topics covered during the week.
    - Plan your learning path for the upcoming weeks.
    
  - **Assignment:**
    - Review your code from the past week and refactor/improve it.
